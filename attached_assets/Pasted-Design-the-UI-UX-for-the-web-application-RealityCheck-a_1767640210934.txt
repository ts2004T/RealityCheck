Design the UI/UX for the web application **RealityCheck**, a Machine Learning–based Fake News Detection system.

UI/UX PHILOSOPHY:
The interface must communicate trust, neutrality, and credibility.
Design should feel journalistic and academic rather than flashy or startup-like.
Minimalism is mandatory.

TARGET USER FLOW:
1. User lands on homepage
2. User pastes a news article into a large text area
3. User clicks a primary action button labeled "Check Reality"
4. System displays prediction result clearly
5. User can reset and check another article

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Single-page application
- Centered content column
- Clear visual hierarchy
- No popups or modals

HEADER:
- Title: "RealityCheck"
- Subtitle: "AI-powered Fake News Detection"
- Simple alignment, no logos or images

INPUT SECTION:
- Large textarea for news article input
- Placeholder text: "Paste the full news article here..."
- Primary button below textarea: "Check Reality"
- Disable button when textarea is empty
- Show subtle loading text: "Analyzing content..."

RESULT DISPLAY:
- Result appears only after submission
- Display result inside a bordered card
- Two possible outputs:
  - "REAL NEWS ✅" (green accent)
  - "FAKE NEWS ❌" (red accent)
- Include one short explanatory sentence below the result
- No probability scores or technical jargon in UI

COLOR PALETTE:
- Background: off-white or very light gray
- Primary text: near-black
- Secondary text: muted gray
- REAL result: muted green
- FAKE result: muted red
- Avoid gradients, neon colors, or dark themes

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use clean sans-serif font (Inter / Poppins / system default)
- Headings slightly bold
- Body text regular weight
- Generous line spacing for readability

INTERACTION DESIGN:
- Button hover state: subtle darkening only
- No animations or transitions
- No emojis except in final result indicator
- No sound effects or illustrations

ACCESSIBILITY:
- High contrast text
- Large readable font sizes
- Clear focus states

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add login, signup, profiles, or dashboards
- Do NOT add charts, graphs, or statistics
- Do NOT add background images or icons
- Do NOT add marketing-style copy
- Do NOT overexplain ML concepts in UI

DESIGN INTENT STATEMENT (for documentation):
"The interface is intentionally minimal to avoid influencing user judgment and to keep focus on the machine learning inference rather than visual persuasion."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
A clean, minimal, trustworthy UI suitable for an academic Machine Learning project, implemented using HTML and CSS and integrated into a Flask application.
