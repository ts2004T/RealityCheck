You are building a complete end-to-end Machine Learning project called **RealityCheck**, a Fake News Detection web application.

GOAL:
Detect whether a news article is REAL or FAKE using classical Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. The system must be academically sound, explainable, and suitable for a college major project review.

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Flask (for backend)
- HTML, CSS (basic frontend)
- Joblib (model persistence)

DATASET REQUIREMENTS:
- CSV file with at least two columns:
  - "text": the news article content
  - "label": 1 for REAL, 0 for FAKE
- Handle missing or empty text values

TEXT PREPROCESSING PIPELINE:
1. Convert text to lowercase
2. Remove punctuation and numbers
3. Remove stopwords
4. Tokenization
5. Lemmatization
Use NLTK for all NLP operations.

FEATURE EXTRACTION:
- Use **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Limit max_features to avoid overfitting
- Fit only on training data

MODEL:
- Primary model: **Logistic Regression**
- Optional comparison: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Train-test split (80-20)
- Set random_state for reproducibility

EVALUATION METRICS:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
Print evaluation results clearly during training.

MODEL SAVING:
- Save trained model and vectorizer using Joblib
- Load them inside Flask app for inference

FLASK APPLICATION:
- Home page with:
  - Text area for pasting news article
  - Submit button
- On submission:
  - Preprocess input
  - Transform using saved TF-IDF vectorizer
  - Predict using trained model
  - Display result clearly:
    - "REAL NEWS ✅" or "FAKE NEWS ❌"

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, minimal design
- Project title: **RealityCheck**
- Subtitle: "AI-powered Fake News Detection"
- Color-coded prediction output

README.md MUST INCLUDE:
- Project overview
- Problem statement
- Tech stack
- How it works (ML pipeline)
- How to run on Replit
- Future improvements

CODE QUALITY:
- Modular and readable
- Proper function separation
- Clear comments for academic explanation
- Avoid hardcoding paths

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT use deep learning
- Do NOT use external APIs
- Keep the system explainable and lightweight

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
A fully working Fake News Detection web app that runs on Replit, accepts user input, and predicts whether the news is real or fake using Machine Learning.
